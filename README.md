# SASS-ZERO

SASS-ZERO is a css framework that brings concepts from [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) and [milligram](https://milligram.io) but with ideas from [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming), [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/book) and [Shape UP](https://basecamp.com/shapeup).

### Milligram

"Programmers donâ€™t need a pixel-perfect design to start implementing. All they need are endpoints: input elements, buttons, places where stored data should appear. These affordances are the core of a user interface design." - [Shape UP](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.2-chapter-10#affordances-before-pixel-perfect-screens).

SASS-ZERO comes with a basic grayscale theme that help you to bring your ideas to life, questions about font, color, spacing and layout can be resolved after the raw affordances.

### Tailwindcss

"Instead of hand-picking values from a limitless pool any time you need to make a decision, start with a smaller set of options." - [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/book).

SASS-ZERO use font, color, spacing, border and etc from [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) but instead the utility-first approach we use [sass variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables).

### BEM

I believe that html is code, therefore it should be named and scoped as well. Developers need to be good with naming things, css is another oportunity to practice.

### Shape UP

SASS-ZERO comes with a implict flow from Shape UP, Find Elemens -> Create Affordance -> Make it Beautiful.

### Refactoring UI

Developers should be able to produce your own design, [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/book) is the book for that.
